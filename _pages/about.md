Hi, I'm Raj, a statistician. I help organisations use data to make well informed business decisions.

In June 2017, I joined the C1X team as a data analyst.

Previously I have:

1. **Self-serve Analytics**: Enabled data access to the entire organization by setting up Apache Superset and Metabase. This helped folks access reports in a self-service manner using industry-leading tools. Allowing easy access to rich reports is truly a game-changer in any organization

2. Developed a URL classification model to identify and enrich an ad impression to provide more context for campaign selection

3. AWS cost optimisation by developing a routing model to match ad impressions with bidders

4. Predicting the anomalous behavior in revenue and send an e-mail alert with the affected metrics

5. Identifying top monetisation friendly users based on various buying intents. This helped us identify which publisher had a premium audience and made us focus more of our efforts on growing those accounts. 

6. Built a category reporting system for a large ecommerce client

7. Worked on a GDPR use-case for our client for meeting their data removal requirements


Outside of all this, I love cooking desi food and morning walks. 

I've lived in `Bengaluru(India)` since 2017 and grew up and completed my education in `New Delhi(India)`.
